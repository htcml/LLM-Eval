hypothesis testing type 1 type 2 errors alpha beta power effect size sample size estimation

What you're solving for 
Explaining the concepts of Type I and Type II errors, alpha, beta, power, effect size, and sample size estimation in hypothesis testing. 
What's given in the problem 

• Definitions and relationships between key statistical concepts. 

Helpful information 

• Hypothesis testing involves comparing a null hypothesis $H_0$) to an alternative hypothesis $H_1$). 
• Type I and Type II errors are potential mistakes in this process. 
• Power analysis helps determine the necessary sample size for a study. 

How to solve 
Define each term and explain their relationships in the context of hypothesis testing. 

1. Step 1 Define Type I and Type II errors 
	• Type I error (false positive): Rejecting $H_0$ when it is true. [1]  
		• The probability of a Type I error is denoted by $\alpha$. [2, 3]  

	• Type II error (false negative): Failing to reject $H_0$ when it is false. 
		• The probability of a Type II error is denoted by $\beta$. [2, 3]  

2. Step 2 Define alpha $\alpha$) 
	• $\alpha$ is the significance level. 
		• It is the probability of making a Type I error. [2, 4]  
		• Common values for $\alpha$ are $0.05$ or $0.01$. 

3. Step 3 Define beta $\beta$) 
	• $\beta$ is the probability of making a Type II error. [2, 4, 5]  

4. Step 4 Define power 
	• Power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false $H_0$. [5]  
		• Power $= 1 - \beta$. 
		• A power of $0.8$ or higher is generally desired. 

5. Step 5 Define effect size 
	• Effect size measures the strength of an effect or relationship. 
		• It is independent of sample size. 
		• Larger effect sizes are easier to detect. 

6. Step 6 Define sample size estimation 
	• Sample size estimation determines the number of participants needed for a study. 
		• It depends on $\alpha$, $\beta$, effect size, and variability. 
		• Larger sample sizes increase power and reduce the risk of Type II errors. 

7. Step 7 Explain the relationships 
	• Decreasing $\alpha$ reduces the risk of Type I error but increases the risk of Type II error (decreases power). 
	• Increasing sample size increases power and reduces the risk of Type II error. 
	• Larger effect sizes lead to higher power. 

Solution 
Type I error is rejecting a true null hypothesis, Type II error is failing to reject a false null hypothesis, alpha is the probability of Type I error, beta is the probability of Type II error, power is $1 - \beta$, effect size measures the strength of an effect, and sample size estimation determines the number of participants needed for a study.
