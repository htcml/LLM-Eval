Here are additional evaluation metrics for voice assistant systems, informed by industry best practices and research:

### Content Quality Metrics
**Appropriateness**  
Assess if responses align with context and user intent without overstepping boundaries[1]. Example: Avoiding jokes during serious requests.

**Contextual Understanding**  
Measure ability to maintain conversation context across multi-turn dialogues[3]. Example: Correctly referencing prior mentions in follow-up questions.

**Ethical Compliance**  
Evaluate adherence to ethical guidelines and avoidance of harmful content[1]. Example: Filtering biased or discriminatory responses.

### User Interaction Metrics
**Task Success Rate**  
Track percentage of user goals fully achieved (e.g., playing correct song, providing accurate weather)[5]. Combines action correctness and completion[4].

**Error Recovery Capability**  
Test ability to detect/correct misunderstandings through clarification requests[4]. Example: "Did you mean 8 AM or 8 PM?"

**Multi-Lingual Code-Switching**  
Assess handling of mixed-language inputs common in bilingual regions[3]. Example: Seamlessly switching between English and Spanish mid-conversation.

### Voice Characteristics
**Prosody Naturalness**  
Evaluate speech rhythm, pitch variation, and emphasis patterns using MOS (Mean Opinion Score) testing[5].

**Emotional Tone Matching**  
Measure ability to adjust vocal emotion to context (e.g., empathetic tone for customer complaints)[5].

**Pronunciation Accuracy**  
Grade articulation of uncommon words/names using phonetic validation[3]. Different from accent as it focuses on individual word correctness.

### System Performance Metrics
**End-to-End Latency**  
Measure time from user speech completion to assistant response playback[4]. Ideal: <1.5 seconds for natural flow[5].

**Barge-In Recognition**  
Test interruption handling during long responses while maintaining context[3].

### Specialized Capabilities
**Personalization Recall**  
Evaluate memory of user preferences across sessions (e.g., dietary restrictions, music tastes)[1].

**Multimodal Coordination**  
Assess synchronization with visual interfaces when applicable (e.g., showing maps while giving directions)[3].

**Privacy Compliance**  
Verify automatic deletion of transient data not explicitly saved by users[1].

Industry benchmarks show top systems achieve 92%+ task success rates with <800ms latency for common requests[5][4]. Regular evaluation should combine automated testing (using tools like Dynabench) and human ratings for nuanced aspects like emotional tone[3][1].
