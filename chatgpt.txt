You're off to a really strong start! Your current metrics cover important basics. Here are **additional metrics** you can use to build a more comprehensive evaluation framework for a voice assistant, especially one like ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode:

---

### 1. **Comprehension**
- **Definition:** Assess whether the assistant correctly understood the user's intent and nuance, even if phrased unusually or with errors.
- **Example:** If the user says, "Uh, whatâ€™s the, like, weather?" the assistant should infer the meaning and respond correctly.

### 2. **Latency**
- **Definition:** Measure the time it takes from the end of the user's speech to the beginning of the assistantâ€™s response.
- **Notes:** Lower latency generally feels more natural and conversational.

### 3. **Prosody and Expressiveness**
- **Definition:** Assess whether the assistantâ€™s voice has natural rhythm, pitch, emphasis, and emotion appropriate to the context.
- **Example:** Excitement when saying "Congratulations!" vs a calm tone when giving directions.

### 4. **Dialog Coherence**
- **Definition:** Evaluate whether the assistantâ€™s responses logically follow the previous exchanges and maintain context over multiple turns.
- **Notes:** Especially important in multi-turn conversations.

### 5. **Voice Naturalness**
- **Definition:** Judge how natural (human-like) the synthetic voice sounds.
- **Notes:** Even if fluent and correct, an unnatural voice can break immersion.

### 6. **Error Recovery Ability**
- **Definition:** Assess how well the assistant handles misunderstandings, interruptions, or ambiguous input.
- **Example:** "I'm sorry, did you mean...?" or graceful re-prompts.

### 7. **Politeness and Tone Appropriateness**
- **Definition:** Assess whether the assistant uses a polite, appropriate tone based on the situation or user emotion.
- **Example:** Being empathetic if the user sounds upset.

### 8. **Volume Appropriateness**
- **Definition:** Measure if the assistant's speaking volume is suitable for the environment or matches the userâ€™s speaking volume.
- **Example:** Speaking more softly at night or louder in noisy environments.

### 9. **Personalization**
- **Definition:** Evaluate whether the assistant adapts to known user preferences (like formality, speed, or frequent topics).

### 10. **Background Noise Robustness**
- **Definition:** Assess how well the assistant understands and responds accurately even when the user's voice input includes background noise.

### 11. **Pronunciation Accuracy**
- **Definition:** Judge whether proper nouns, rare words, foreign names, etc., are pronounced correctly.
- **Example:** Correct pronunciation of "Gujarat," "Kierkegaard," or "SÃ£o Paulo."

Would you also like me to help organize all these metrics into a **structured evaluation rubric** (e.g., scoring guidelines or a checklist format)?  
It would make it easier if you're planning to implement it in QA or user studies. ðŸ“‹
