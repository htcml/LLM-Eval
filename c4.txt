Got it â€” you want the **evaluation framework** to target **any system that uses multimodal models** with **voice input and voice output only**, not just voice assistants.

I'll **rewrite and generalize** the whole report to fit your new objective. It will still include and polish your original ideas, but the focus will be broader, covering *all* applications/systems (not just assistants). Hereâ€™s the new version:

# Evaluation Framework for Voice-Only Multimodal Systems  
*(Voice Input âž” Voice Output)*

## Overview
This framework provides a structured approach for evaluating applications and systems that use multimodal models operating exclusively with voice input and voice output. It is designed to assess the linguistic quality, speech naturalness, comprehension ability, and responsiveness of such systems in single-turn interactions.

## Problem Statement
Systems powered by multimodal models must handle voice interactions accurately and naturally, without relying on text or visual input/output. In voice-only scenarios, each interaction must stand on its own: the system must understand the spoken input, reason correctly, and generate high-quality spoken output immediately. This framework defines key evaluation metrics to systematically measure and improve single-turn performance in voice-only multimodal systems.

# Evaluation Metrics

Each metric is scored individually. Suggested scoring scale:
- **5 (Excellent):** No noticeable issues.
- **4 (Good):** Minor, non-disruptive issues.
- **3 (Fair):** Noticeable issues but still acceptable.
- **2 (Poor):** Major issues that impact quality.
- **1 (Unacceptable):** Severe issues that make the interaction fail.

---

## 1. Correctness
- **Definition:** Whether the systemâ€™s voice output is factually accurate and directly addresses the voice input prompt.
- **Example:**  
  - **Input:** "Whatâ€™s the capital of France?"  
  - **Expected Output:** "The capital of France is Paris."
- **Scoring Notes:** Penalize hallucinations, factual errors, or incomplete answers.

---

## 2. Language Match
- **Definition:** Whether the output language matches the language used in the input.
- **Example:**  
  - **Input (in Spanish):** "Â¿QuÃ© hora es?"  
  - **Expected Output:** A response in Spanish.
- **Scoring Notes:** Responses in the wrong language or unnecessary code-switching should lower the score.

---

## 3. Conciseness
- **Definition:** Whether the system's response is appropriately brief â€” not overly verbose, not overly short.
- **Example:**  
  - **Good:** A short, clear definition of "photosynthesis."
  - **Poor:** A long, lecture-style explanation for a simple request.
- **Scoring Notes:** Brevity must not sacrifice informativeness.

---

## 4. Fluency
- **Definition:** Whether the spoken output is grammatically correct, coherent, and free of awkward pauses or disfluencies.
- **Example:**  
  - Poor fluency might include filler words like "uh" or "um" or fragmented sentences.
- **Scoring Notes:** Focus on grammar, rhythm, and clarity.

---

## 5. Accent Appropriateness
- **Definition:** Whether the synthetic voice uses an accent that is appropriate and easy to understand for the language used.
- **Example:**  
  - An American English request should ideally produce a neutral or American English-accented response.
- **Scoring Notes:** Heavy, unexpected accents that impair comprehension reduce the score.

---

## 6. Comprehension
- **Definition:** Whether the system correctly interprets the userâ€™s voice input, even if it includes disfluencies or non-standard phrasing.
- **Example:**  
  - **Input:** "Uh, can you tell me, like, the weather?"  
  - **Expected Understanding:** A request for the weather forecast.
- **Scoring Notes:** Misinterpretation lowers the score.

---

## 7. Latency
- **Definition:** How quickly the system starts speaking after the user finishes speaking.
- **Scoring Notes:** Short, natural response times are ideal. Long or noticeable delays lower the score.

---

## 8. Prosody and Expressiveness
- **Definition:** Whether the systemâ€™s speech output includes natural-sounding rhythm, pitch, emphasis, and appropriate emotional expression.
- **Example:**  
  - Cheerfully saying "Happy Birthday!" with lively intonation.
- **Scoring Notes:** Robotic or overly flat delivery is penalized.

---

## 9. Voice Naturalness
- **Definition:** How human-like and pleasant the voice output sounds.
- **Scoring Notes:** Synthetic, mechanical, or overly robotic voices reduce the score even if the content is correct.

---

## 10. Error Recovery Ability
- **Definition:** Whether the system handles unclear or ambiguous voice input gracefully within a single turn.
- **Example:**  
  - If unclear, the system might ask, "Did you mean the weather forecast or the weather report?"
- **Scoring Notes:** Even though limited in a single-turn setup, some recovery strategies should be scored.

---

## 11. Politeness and Tone Appropriateness
- **Definition:** Whether the tone used is polite, professional, and fits the context of the userâ€™s input.
- **Example:**  
  - Using an empathetic tone when responding to negative or sensitive topics.
- **Scoring Notes:** Rudeness, inappropriate casualness, or mismatch in tone lower the score.

---

## 12. Volume Appropriateness
- **Definition:** Whether the output is at an appropriate volume for standard listening environments.
- **Scoring Notes:** Speech that is too loud or too soft should be penalized.

---

## 13. Personalization (Optional)
- **Definition:** Whether the system adapts to known user preferences, such as speech speed, tone, or formality, if applicable.
- **Scoring Notes:** Bonus points for personalized, user-tailored responses if supported.

---

## 14. Background Noise Robustness
- **Definition:** How well the system correctly interprets spoken input in the presence of background noise.
- **Example:**  
  - Correctly understanding a request made in a noisy cafÃ© environment.
- **Scoring Notes:** Misunderstandings due to ambient noise reduce the score.

---

## 15. Pronunciation Accuracy
- **Definition:** Whether the system correctly pronounces common and uncommon words, including names, locations, and technical terms.
- **Example:**  
  - Proper pronunciation of "Gujarat," "Kierkegaard," or "SÃ£o Paulo."
- **Scoring Notes:** Frequent mispronunciations lower the score.

---

# Usage Notes
- **Scope:**  
  This evaluation focuses on **single-turn** interactions. Multi-turn conversation handling (e.g., remembering previous exchanges) is **not included**.

- **Evaluator Comments:**  
  Evaluators should also leave brief free-text comments if any particular issue notably affects the overall perception of quality.
