Understood â€” thanks for clarifying!

You don't want to measure **whether the system can detect** things like fraud or noise.  
You want **metrics the system can use to *evaluate the quality or characteristics* of the input voice itself** â€” regardless of what the system *does* with that information.

I'll rewrite **Part 3: Input Voice Evaluation Metrics** to fit this correct intention.  
Hereâ€™s the clean rewritten version:

# Part 3: Input Voice Evaluation Metrics (Voice Input Characteristics)

This section defines the key properties of the **user's voice input** that the system should evaluate during single-turn interactions.

These metrics are **descriptive assessments** of the input signal quality and content â€” **not** about the system's detection capabilities or defense mechanisms.

---

### 19. Input Authenticity
- **Definition:** Assessment of whether the incoming voice sounds like natural human speech, without signs of being synthetic, manipulated, or artificially generated.
- **Scoring Notes:**  
  - Natural human voices score higher.
  - Voices that sound robotic, overly smooth, glitchy, or suspicious score lower.

---

### 20. Input Language Consistency
- **Definition:** Assessment of whether the voice input consistently uses one primary language, without unnecessary switching or mixing.
- **Scoring Notes:**  
  - Single, clear language use scores higher.
  - Frequent or unexpected language switching without clear context scores lower.

---

### 21. Input Audio Quality
- **Definition:** Assessment of the technical clarity of the voice input, including signal-to-noise ratio, volume levels, and absence of distortions.
- **Scoring Notes:**  
  - Crisp, clear audio with minimal background noise scores higher.
  - Noisy, distorted, or very quiet/loud inputs score lower.

---

### 22. Input Fluency
- **Definition:** Assessment of the fluency of the spoken input â€” whether it flows naturally without excessive hesitations, repetitions, or broken phrases.
- **Scoring Notes:**  
  - Fluent, smooth input scores higher.
  - Input with frequent filler words ("um," "uh"), false starts, or interruptions scores lower.

---

### 23. Input Emotional Tone
- **Definition:** Assessment of the emotional tone conveyed by the user's speech (e.g., calm, angry, excited), if detectable and relevant.
- **Scoring Notes:**  
  - Clear, natural emotional expressions are noted positively.
  - Emotionally ambiguous, flat, or overly exaggerated inputs are noted neutrally or negatively depending on context.

# Summary Table of Input Metrics

| Metric | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| Input Authenticity | Checks if the voice sounds naturally human |
| Input Language Consistency | Checks language usage consistency |
| Input Audio Quality | Checks clarity and noise levels |
| Input Fluency | Checks naturalness of spoken delivery |
| Input Emotional Tone | Checks emotional expressiveness in speech |

---

# Notes
- These metrics focus purely on **characterizing the input voice**.  
- They are intended to **support** input understanding, adaptation, or further risk analysis.  
- They are **agnostic** to whether the system takes defensive actions (e.g., rejecting fraudulent inputs).

Would you also like me to optionally add **even more advanced input metrics**, like **Speaker Consistency** (whether one speakerâ€™s voice is stable across turns) or **Pronunciation Clarity** (input-side)?  
I can expand a little if you want a "gold standard" evaluation set! ðŸŒŸ
