Got it â€” you want to **add "Fraudulence Check"** back in, but clearly framed as an **input evaluation metric** â€” meaning:  
> The system should assess whether the **input voice seems fraudulent**, not whether it handles fraud correctly afterward.

I'll insert it cleanly into Part 3 with matching style. Here's the updated and expanded **Part 3**:

# Part 3: Input Voice Evaluation Metrics (Voice Input Characteristics)

This section defines the key properties of the **user's voice input** that the system should evaluate during single-turn interactions.  
Metrics focus on **analyzing the input** itself, not on downstream actions.

---

### 19. Input Authenticity
- **Definition:** Assessment of whether the incoming voice sounds like natural human speech, without signs of being synthetic, manipulated, or artificially generated.
- **Scoring Notes:**  
  - Natural human voices score higher.
  - Voices that sound robotic, overly smooth, glitchy, or suspicious score lower.

---

### 20. Input Language Consistency
- **Definition:** Assessment of whether the voice input consistently uses one primary language, without unnecessary switching or mixing.
- **Scoring Notes:**  
  - Single, clear language use scores higher.
  - Frequent or unexpected language switching without clear context scores lower.

---

### 21. Input Audio Quality
- **Definition:** Assessment of the technical clarity of the voice input, including signal-to-noise ratio, volume levels, and absence of distortions.
- **Scoring Notes:**  
  - Crisp, clear audio with minimal background noise scores higher.
  - Noisy, distorted, or very quiet/loud inputs score lower.

---

### 22. Input Fluency
- **Definition:** Assessment of the fluency of the spoken input â€” whether it flows naturally without excessive hesitations, repetitions, or broken phrases.
- **Scoring Notes:**  
  - Fluent, smooth input scores higher.
  - Input with frequent filler words ("um," "uh"), false starts, or interruptions scores lower.

---

### 23. Input Emotional Tone
- **Definition:** Assessment of the emotional tone conveyed by the user's speech (e.g., calm, angry, excited), if detectable and relevant.
- **Scoring Notes:**  
  - Clear, natural emotional expressions are noted positively.
  - Emotionally ambiguous, flat, or overly exaggerated inputs are noted neutrally or negatively depending on context.

---

### 24. Fraudulence Check
- **Definition:** Assessment of whether the voice input shows signs of being fraudulent, such as spoofed recordings, deepfake audio, replay attacks, or impersonations.
- **Scoring Notes:**  
  - Authentic, live, human voices score higher.
  - Voices exhibiting suspicious patterns (e.g., unnatural timing, microphone artifacts, identical phrasing, synthetic qualities) score lower.
  - Extremely suspicious inputs should be flagged as high fraud risk.

# Updated Summary Table of Input Metrics

| Metric | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| Input Authenticity | Checks if the voice sounds naturally human |
| Input Language Consistency | Checks language usage consistency |
| Input Audio Quality | Checks clarity and noise levels |
| Input Fluency | Checks naturalness of spoken delivery |
| Input Emotional Tone | Checks emotional expressiveness in speech |
| Fraudulence Check | Evaluates likelihood of input being spoofed, faked, or fraudulent |

---

# Notes
- These input metrics allow the system to **analyze** incoming voice characteristics at a detailed level.
- **Fraudulence Check** is critical for protecting against spoofed or adversarial voice attacks.
- Evaluation focuses on **single-turn input characteristics**, not on multi-turn behaviors or identity verification processes.

âœ… Now you have a **complete Part 3** that fits your new needs, including the **Fraudulence Check** you asked for â€” properly described!  
Would you also like me to help next by drafting a **very compact table** you can plug into Excel for evaluations? ðŸ“‹âœ¨  
It would look super clean!
